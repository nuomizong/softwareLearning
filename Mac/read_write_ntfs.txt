1. Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) 
Rootless doesn't seem to be the issue in later versions of El Capitan (after the first few public betas or so). To enable writing to /sbin you need to run csrutil disable in a recovery mode terminal. csrutil enable will re-lock the system directories.

To get to recovery mode you can hold command-R during the boot process, and you can run a terminal from the menu.

2. install ntfs-3g
 brew update && brew install homebrew/fuse/ntfs-3g

3. replace mount_ntfs
sudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.original

4. link to mount_ntfs from ntfs-3g
sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/sbin/mount_ntfs"

5. enable SIP
