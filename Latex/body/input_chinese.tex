\chapter{Use Chinese Characters in TexStudio}
There are several thins need to be done before TexStudio displays and compiles Chinese Characters correctly.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The very first thing to do is to make sure the \textbf{\% !Mode:: \textquotesingle\textquotesingle TeX:UTF-8\textquotesingle\textquotesingle} at the beginning of each file, so that TexStudio can open file in \textbf{utf-8} encoding mode.
	\item use CJK package: \textbf{\textbackslash usepackage\{CJKutf8\}}
	\item use CJK environment:\textbf{ \textbackslash begin\{CJK*\}\{UTF8\}\{song\} and \textbackslash end\{CJK*\}} just after \textbf{\textbackslash begin\{document\}} and \textbf{\textbackslash end\{document\}}
		
\end{enumerate}
