	The data types supported by \textbf{Windows} are used to define function return values, function and message parameters, and structure members. They define the size and meaning of these elements. For more information about the underlying C/C++ data types, seee \textbf{Data Type Ranges}.
	
	The following table contains the following types:character, integer, Boolean, pointer, and handle. The character, integer, and Boolean types are common to most C compilers. Most of the pointer-type begin with a prefix of P or LP. Handles refer to a resource that has been loaded into memory.
	
	For more information about handling 64-bit integers, see \textbf{Large Integers}.
