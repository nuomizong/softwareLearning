\section{Initialize const members}
There are couple of ways to initialize the const members inside the class.

Definition of const member in general, needs initialization of variable too.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First way:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
class A
{
	static int const a; // declaration
};

int const A::a=10; //defining the static member outside the class.
\end{lstlisting}

\item Second way:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
class A
{
	const int b;
	A(int c): b(c) {}// const member initialized in initialization list.
};
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
