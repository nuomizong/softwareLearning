Open the Approximation Editor (Window > Rendering Editors > mental ray > Approximation Editor).
Click the Create button beside the Subdivision approx. (Poly, Subdiv) attribute to create and assign a subdivision approximation to your polygon.
Render the scene in mental ray.

Note:
You can also smooth polygon meshes by selecting Mesh > Smooth. This method creates denser geometry in the scene view and can increase the number of data calculations for interactive manipulation.
