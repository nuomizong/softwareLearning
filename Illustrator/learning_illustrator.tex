\section{Make a Triangle}
Select the \textbf{Polygon Tool}. If you want to start with a Triangle, \textbf{left click} once on the artboard where you want the shape to appear. A dialogue box will appear asking what radius you want the shape to be and how many sides you want it to have. See figure \ref{fig:makeTriangle}.

\section{Draw straight line segments with the Pen Tool}
The simplest path you can draw with the Pen tool is a straight line, made by clicking the Pen tool to create two anchor points. By continuing to click, you create a path made of straight line segments connected by corner points.

\label{fig:straight_segments}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the \textbf{Pen tool}.
\item Position the \textbf{Pen tool} where you want the straight segment to begin, and click to define the first anchor point (do not drag).\\
\textbf{Note:}\textit{ The first segment you draw will not be visible until you click a second anchor point. (Select the Rubber Band option in Photoshop to preview path segments.) Also, if direction lines appear, you’ve accidentally dragged the Pen tool; choose \textbf{Edit} $ > $ \textbf{Undo}, and click again.}
\item Click again where you want the segment to end (Shift-click to constrain the angle of the segment to a multiple of 45°).
\item Continue clicking to set anchor points for additional straight segments. \\
The last anchor point you add always appears as a solid square, indicating that it is selected. Previously defined anchor points become hollow, and deselected, as you add more anchor points.
\item Complete the path by doing one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item To close the path, position the Pen tool over the first (hollow) anchor point. A small circle appears next to the Pen tool pointer  when it is positioned correctly. Click or drag to close the path.
\item To leave the path open, Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) anywhere away from all objects.\\

To leave the path open, you can also select a different tool, or choose Select $ > $ Deselect in Illustrator or \textbf{Edit} $ > $ \textbf{Deselect} All in InDesign. In InDesign or Illustrator, you can also simply press Enter or Return to leave the path open.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
